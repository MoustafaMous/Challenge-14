# variables serve as the primary means of data storage in python
# variables allow us to name data so it's easier to understand and use in code
# variables must have a name and value and type

# Create variables
company_name = "Wells Fargo"
years_in_business = 92
stock_price = 43.28
us_based = True

print(company_name)
print(us_based)
print(years_in_business)
print(stock_price)


# Print the variables

# Prints the data type of each declared variable
print("Data type of stock price is: ", type(stock_price))

# Using variable names in calculations
total_miles = 300
gallons_gas = 20
miles_per_gallon = total_miles / gallons_gas
print(miles_per_gallon)


kilometers = 0.62 * total_miles
print(kilometers)
print("Kilometers = ", kilometers)
print(f"Kilometers = {kilometers}")
